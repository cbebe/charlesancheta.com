            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing). For a few years now I've always kind of just stuck with 170 cm because that's what was in my driver's license when I got it 5 years ago (I really need to pass the road test this year). I'm not even sure if that was right at the time.</p><p>So, I took a couple of IKEA measuring tapes (courtesy of Jherzey), put them together on a post in our basement, got a square ruler (triangular?

I still haven't caught up to my dad's peak height (176 cm), but he's a bit shorter now that he's older, so it's okay. My hair can add at least 2 inches ðŸ˜‚.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I am Charles, a Computer Engineering Student working as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p><p>For someone who spends a lot of time typing in front of a computer, I write down very little of my thoughts. Most stuff that I come back to for memories are just old code and old pictures, and this should hopefully change that.</p>]]></content:encoded>
