            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was short trial, but GitHub Pages just works better for me.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I moved my website from GitHub Pages to Netlify, hoping
for a better development and production experience. I didn't really have a need
to move just yet, but I wanted to see what the buzz about Netlify was about. So
I spent a few hours setting it up and pointing my domain to the Netlify app.</p><p>It was working just fine at first, until I started making updates. The page
would just load indefinitely and I would have to visit <code>cbebe.netlify.app</code>
first before <code>charlesancheta.com</code> would behave properly. I've had a few
embarrassing moments showing my website to people for a couple times and it
refusing to load.</p><p>Another annoying was that every pull request and push to the master branch
would trigger a build, even if none of the pages were modified. Netlify only
provides a limited about of build time every month, so I found myself
cancelling more builds in the Netlify dashboard more often than I manually
deployed a build using the command line. This could be nice if other people
were contributing to this repo, but since this is a personal website, I find
that unlikely.</p><p>Realizing these, I moved back to GitHub Pages and manually deploying with the
CLI. Maybe in the future where I would have to actually launch a
production-level static website that I would revisit Netlify, but for now, I'll
stick with my current workflow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing).
For a few years now I've always kind of just stuck with 170 cm because that's
what was in my driver's license when I got it 5 years ago (I really need to
pass the road test this year). I'm not even sure if that was right at the time.</p><p>So, I took a couple of IKEA measuring tapes (courtesy of Jherzey), put them
together on a post in our basement, got a square ruler (triangular?

<a href="https://philnews.ph/2021/06/10/eskwala-in-english-translate-eskwala-in-english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>eskwala</em></a>))
and measured my height.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A square measuring my height at 173 cm" src="/assets/images/173cm-878f5d7a25cfd68eb8a8389497e78c23.webp" width="1536" height="2048" class="img_DCeH"></p><p>So I guess I grew 3 cm in those 5 years? I still haven't caught up to my dad's
peak height (176 cm), but he's a bit shorter now that he's older, so it's okay.
My hair can add at least 2 inches ðŸ˜‚.</p>]]></content:encoded>

a Full Stack Web Developer.</p><p>For someone who spends a lot of time typing in front of a computer, I write
down very little of my thoughts. Most stuff that I come back to for memories
are just old code and old pictures, and this should hopefully change that.</p>]]></content:encoded>
