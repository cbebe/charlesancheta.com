I didn\'t really have a need\\nto move just yet, but I wanted to see what the buzz about Netlify was about. So\\nI spent a few hours setting it up and pointing my domain to the Netlify app.\\n\\nIt was working just fine at first, until I started making updates. The page\\nwould just load indefinitely and I would have to visit `cbebe.netlify.app`\\nfirst before `charlesancheta.com` would behave properly. I\'ve had a few\\nembarrassing moments showing my website to people for a couple times and it\\nrefusing to load.\\n\\nAnother annoying was that every pull request and push to the master branch\\nwould trigger a build, even if none of the pages were modified. Netlify only\\nprovides a limited about of build time every month, so I found myself\\ncancelling more builds in the Netlify dashboard more often than I manually\\ndeployed a build using the command line. This could be nice if other people\\nwere contributing to this repo, but since this is a personal website, I find\\nthat unlikely.\\n\\nRealizing these, I moved back to GitHub Pages and manually deploying with the\\nCLI. Maybe in the future where I would have to actually launch a\\nproduction-level static website that I would revisit Netlify, but for now, I\'ll\\nstick with my current workflow."},{"id":"/2022/06/07/friendship-ended","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/06/07/friendship-ended","editUrl":"https://github.com/cbebe/charlesancheta.com/edit/master/blog/2022-06-07-friendship-ended/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-07-friendship-ended/index.md","title":"Friendship Ended with TypeScript, now Go is My Best Friend","description":"Friendship ended","date":"2022-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"dev","permalink":"/blog/tags/dev"},{"label":"go","permalink":"/blog/tags/go"},{"label":"typescript","permalink":"/blog/tags/typescript"},{"label":"backend","permalink":"/blog/tags/backend"},{"label":"meme","permalink":"/blog/tags/meme"}],"readingTime":0.075,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Ancheta","title":"Computer Engineering Student","url":"https://github.com/cbebe","imageURL":"https://github.com/cbebe.png","key":"cbebe"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Friendship Ended with TypeScript, now Go is My Best Friend","authors":"cbebe","tags":["dev","go","typescript","backend","meme"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Bye bye Netlify","permalink":"/blog/bye-bye-netlify"},"nextItem":{"title":"TIL: My actual height","permalink":"/blog/til/my-actual-height"}},"content":"![Friendship ended](./friendship-ended.webp)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nNo blog post here, just a quick edit I made in GIMP."},{"id":"til/my-actual-height","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/til/my-actual-height","editUrl":"https://github.com/cbebe/charlesancheta.com/edit/master/blog/til/2022-05-29-my-actual-height/index.md","source":"@site/blog/til/2022-05-29-my-actual-height/index.md","title":"TIL: My actual height","description":"Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing).","date":"2022-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 29, 2022","tags":[{"label":"til","permalink":"/blog/tags/til"}],"readingTime":0.75,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Charles Ancheta","title":"Computer Engineering Student","url":"https://github.com/cbebe","imageURL":"https://github.com/cbebe.png","key":"cbebe"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"TIL: My actual height","slug":"til/my-actual-height","authors":"cbebe","tags":["til"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Friendship Ended with TypeScript, now Go is My Best Friend","permalink":"/blog/2022/06/07/friendship-ended"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome!","permalink":"/blog/welcome"}},"content":"Today I learned what my actual height was (at least at the time of writing).\\nFor a few years now I\'ve always kind of just stuck with 170 cm because that\'s\\nwhat was in my driver\'s license when I got it 5 years ago (I really need to\\npass the road test this year).
